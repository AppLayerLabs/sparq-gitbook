# Bridging

As explained in [1.1](https://github.com/SparqNet/sparq-docs/blob/development/Sparq\_en-US/ch1/1-1.md), there are inherent flexibility problems with **native** and **application-specific** chains when compared to traditional EVM chains.

Those problems could heavily damage the reputation of a project built on them, and our solution is to allow Sparq-enabled blockchains to natively communicate with each other by using the Gateway Network as a middleman. We call that **bridging**.

It's possible to bridge _arbitrary data_ and _tokens_, both _between OrbiterSDK nodes_ and _between OrbiterSDK and external networks_.
