# Validators

A Validator is a community member who has set up a node and locked at least 200,000 $SPARQ through the `addValidator` transaction, using the Validator's address as an argument. They create blocks, the "randomness" seed used to select the next block creator, and are responsible for gathering and signing data on bridging and blocks. Our Validators require a token lockup of only 200,000 $SPARQ tokens to run a Validator for a Gateway Network, and 1,000 $SPARQ to mint an NFT that holds the binary for the app-chain, with a $100 fee for hard forks.
