# How SparqNet works

This chapter aims to show an overview on the more conceptual parts of the SparqNet system and how they work. Check the subchapters for more details.

SparqNetâ€™s functionality is contained in five primary components: validators, sentinels, subnets, bridging, and rdPoS, the latter of which is separated into its own chapter.
