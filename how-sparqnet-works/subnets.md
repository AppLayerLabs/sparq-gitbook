# Subnets

Subnets are blockchains built using OrbiterSDK and can communicate with SparqNet. A Subnet primarily enables developers to create a chain dedicated to a particular application, with the chainâ€™s rules tailored to the security, performance, speed, decentralization and other service delivery needs of the application.&#x20;

All the languages supported here compile to a binary. Additionally, whoever sets up a Subnet is in charge of validating the transactions on it and attracting others to run validator nodes.
