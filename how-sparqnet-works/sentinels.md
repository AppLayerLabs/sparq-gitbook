# Sentinels

Sentinels are similar to Validators, except they cannot create blocks nor act on their own. It is required that both randomly selected Validators and Sentinels send the same data to the requester, otherwise they will be reported to the network as a malicious node. Sparq Labs Inc. and its partners hosts them to ensure that will not happen.
