# Welcome to SparqNet Docs

Welcome to the central hub for SparqNet documentation. This repository includes explainers, information on all the core components of SparqNet, details of how SparqNet was designed and its architecture, how the SparqNet protocol works, a glossary of terms, as well as community resources.

Find information on SparqNet SDK documentation, developer guides, codes, and more. The reader should be substantially conversant with Unified Modeling Language (UML) since some sections contain diagrams elaborating the concepts.
