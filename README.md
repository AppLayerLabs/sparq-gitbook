# Welcome to SparqNet Docs

Welcome to the central hub for SparqNet documentation. This repository contains information on all the core components of SparqNet, such as design and architecture details, how the SparqNet protocol works, a glossary of terms, community resources, SDK documentation, developer guides, code snippets and more.

The reader should be substantially familiar with Unified Modeling Language (UML), as some sections contain diagrams that further elaborate the concepts explained.
