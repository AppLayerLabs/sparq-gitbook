# How AppLayer works

This chapter aims to show an overview on the more conceptual parts of the AppLayer system and how they work. Check the subchapters for more details.

AppLayerâ€™s functionality is contained in five primary components: *Validators*, *Sentinels*, *AppLayers*, *Chain Abstraction* and *rdPoS*, the latter of which is separated into its own chapter.
