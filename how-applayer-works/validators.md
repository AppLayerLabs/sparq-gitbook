# Validators

A Validator is a computer typically housed in a datacenter and commonly referred to as a server, with a sole purpose of executing and securing a blockchain network.

Validators require a token lockup of at least 200,000 $APPL through the `addValidator` transaction to be accepted for validation in the AppLayer Network, and to register 3rd-party stateful pre-compiles. They create blocks, generate the "randomness" seed used to select the next block creator, and are responsible for gathering and signing data on bridging and blocks.

Those deploying an AppLayer, more commonly known as an application chain, will register their chain through a transaction with fees paid to AppLayer's Network. These tokens are distributed to the managing company currently developing AppLayer and will be allocated to the foundation treasury at a future date.
