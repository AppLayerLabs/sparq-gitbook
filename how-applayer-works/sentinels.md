# Sentinels

Sentinels are similar to Validators, except they cannot create blocks nor act on their own. It is required that both randomly selected Validators and Sentinels send the same data to the requester, otherwise they will be reported to the network as a malicious node. AppLayer Labs and its partners host them to ensure that will not happen.

Sentinels are open for trusted 3rd parties to host and are KYC'd entities with a high level of scrutiny. Eventually as the network and underlying technology matures, Sentinels will be phased out in favor of a fully permissionless system.

Sentinels require 200,000 $APPL tokens as a prerequisite and are only accepted by the network after a whitelisting by AppLayer Labs.
