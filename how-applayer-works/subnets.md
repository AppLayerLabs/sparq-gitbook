# Subnets

Subnets are blockchains built using the BDK that can communicate with the AppLayer network. A Subnet primarily enables developers to create a chain dedicated to a particular application, with the chainâ€™s rules tailored to the security, performance, speed, decentralization and other service delivery needs of the application.

All the languages supported here compile to a binary. Additionally, whoever sets up a Subnet is in charge of validating the transactions on it and attracting others to run Validator nodes for it.
