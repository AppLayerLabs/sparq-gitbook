# OpenZeppelin Libraries

Since the majority of Solidity contracts depend on OpenZeppelin libraries, SparqNet will be creating equivalents for these libraries without requiring the transpilation of the OpenZeppelin contract source code. You simply link with "`openzeppelin`" on the import (e.g. import "`@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol`";)
