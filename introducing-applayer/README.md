# Introducing AppLayer

This chapter aims to introduce the core concepts behind AppLayer, such as the context it's being built in, the problems with existing projects, what are the solutions we perceive (as well as their caveats), and how AppLayer is meant to bridge those gaps to bring forward new ways for developing in the blockchain space, as well as the potential use cases it could cover.
