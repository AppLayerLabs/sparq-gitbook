# Introducing SparqNet

This chapter aims to introduce the core concepts behind SparqNet, such as the context it's being built in, the problems with existing projects, what are the solutions we perceive (as well as their caveats), and how SparqNet is meant to bridge those gaps and bring forward new ways to develop on the blockchain space, as well as the potential use cases it could cover.
