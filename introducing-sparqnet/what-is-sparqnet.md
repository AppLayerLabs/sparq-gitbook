# What is SparqNet?

The SparqNet project is made up of two parts:

* An SDK (and documentation) for developers to easily build application-specific Web 2.0 native chains with unprecedented freedom (hereby denominated [**OrbiterSDK**](https://github.com/SparqNet/orbitersdk-cpp)); and
* A network that allows the bridging of data and assets between these app-specific chains and external chains (hereby denominated **SparqNet**).

Therefore, blockchains built using OrbiterSDK are able to communicate with each other through SparqNet.

#### Potential use cases

SparqNet provides all the essential tools to build a wide range of products for decentralized finance, data storage, gaming, and much more. It can power applications such as:

* **DeFi**: build financial products with security and ease. Leveraging SparqNet's performance network enables a whole new generation of DeFi products such as facilitating millions of trades per second.
* **Data Storage**: SparqNet makes data storage easier, more affordable, and secure. Builders can store backups of whole ledgers or fully decentralize any form of a database natively in the Sparq network.
* **GameFi**: gaming projects now have performance infrastructure to build game engines capable of leveraging a pure blockchain solution with a whole new range of in-game features.

Other potential use cases include (but not limited to):

* Multiplayer games/servers
* Decentralized exchange
* Decentralized and hyper available caching for dAppsâ€™ databases
* Decentralized e-mail
* HR portal
* VPN
* Cloud services
* Video rendering
* E-commerce
* Arbitrage bot
* Blockchain-enabled utilities such as water and power
* Supply chain and logistics
